Whether you're a data wizzard or a great organizer who abhors numbers, your contribution makes a difference. Here is how.

<h2 id="join_events">
    Join our events as a data scientist
</h2>
Only have an evening or a weekend to spare? Help nonprofits by joining one of our events! Lorem. 

<h2 id="ambassadors">
    Work with non-profits as a data ambassador (require DS knowledge)
</h2>
The next step in volunteering is helping us to consult npos in office hours, scope projects in data impact mapping workshops and prepare projects for datathons. Apply as a data ambassador and we will contact you with calls to help in these formats.

<h2 id="dssg_organization">
    Join the team and help organize DSSG Berlin (no Data Science required)
</h2>
You want to help but are not a data scientits or are more interested in organising? We'd love to get to know you!
