# Become a volunteer at DSSG now.
Whether you're a data wizard or a great organizer who abhors numbers, your contribution makes a difference. Here is how.

## Join our events as a data scientist.
Only have an evening or a weekend to spare? Help nonprofits
by joining one of our events! Lorem.

## Work with non-profits as a data ambassador (Data Science knowledge is requared).
The next step in volunteering is helping us to consult npos in office hours,
scope projects in data impact mapping workshops and prepare projects for datathons.
Apply as a data ambassador and we will contact you with calls to help in these formats.

## Join the team and help organize DSSG Berlin (no Data Science knowledge is required).
"You want to help but are not a data scientist or
are more interested in organizing? We'd love to get to know you!

The DSSG pride itself from its structure and efficiency.
Volunteers can join the following areas.
Each team is autonomous and set its own agenda.
Volunteers are welcome to join as many areas as they please.
