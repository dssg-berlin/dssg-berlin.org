Last year, [we tried out an event, Data Science Speed Dating](https://blog.dssg-berlin.org/data-science-speed-dating-in-berlin-9c75a44a5c00), where we matched up non-profit organisations with volunteer data analysts and data scientists in a speed dating type of event.

It seemed to go down well last time [(read our write up here)](https://blog.dssg-berlin.org/data-science-speed-dating-in-berlin-9c75a44a5c00), so we’re doing our next one on **_Thursday 22nd March 2018,_ **at co-up, everybody’s favourite nerd Berlin community space.

#### Wait, why would I even go to this?

**If you’re good at working with data**, you get to use your skills for something socially useful, meet nice people, and understand problems outside your day-to-day.

**If you’re in a non-profit organisation**, you get access to the insight and experience of a load of expensive people thinking about a thorny data problem you’re wrestling with, who you couldn’t typically afford. And you meet loads of nice people.

Everyone wins!

#### Okay, that sounds cool. Where do I sign up?

You can [sign up on eventbrite](http://tickets-43546017310) — and if you can’t make it, help make the world a better place and either let a data savvy friend now, or send a non-profit our way.

Thanks, and see you on the 22nd.

#### [Still here? Why are you not signing up?](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/dssg-data-science-speed-dating-march-2018-tickets-43546017310)

P.S If you’re hiring, and you’re up for helping us cover the cost of the food (it was about 100 EUR for 30 people last time), [_we’d love to chat_](mailto:contact@dssg-berlin.org)_— drop us a line at contact@dssg-berlin.org_.
