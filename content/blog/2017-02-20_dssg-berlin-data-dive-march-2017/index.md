Scene from our last Data Dive in 2015



#### What is a Data Dive?

A Data Dive is an event that partners up curious, clever, quantitative data scientists* (that’s you!) with curious, clever, empathetic non-profit people (you’ll love them!) to take a stab at real analytical challenges our partner non-profit organizations are facing. Over the weekend you’ll have a chance to step away from your regular problem sets, contribute to a good cause, and meet other socially minded problem solvers.

We’re partnering with [Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft](https://www.krebsgesellschaft.de/) and [SchulePlus](https://www.schule-plus.de/) who have challenging problems and are really happy that you want to help solve them.

#### Who should sign up?

For the challenges our non-profit partners are facing the following skills would be especially useful:

*   German cancer society: NLP, topic modeling/text clustering, text visualisation, experiences with scientific publishing
*   SchulePLUS: data visualisation, text pre-processing (stemming, string matching etc), working with Google Adwords data

If you are not experienced in these areas, but are smart and eager to pick up new skills, don’t hesitate to register! We are a diverse and inclusive group. Please come, no matter your race, gender and sexual orientation. We support the [http://berlincodeofconduct.org](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/).

_If you are you are from a non-profit and curious what we are doing, please join us on Sunday just for the final presentations!_
