        <h1>Data Analysis for Vocational Orientation and Cancer Knowledge Management</h1>

        <div class="measure-wide lh-copy f4">
            <p>In March 2017, the second Data Science for Social Good Berlin Data Dive took place. This time, we brought together <a href="https://www.krebsgesellschaft.de/german-cancer-society.html">German Cancer Society</a>, <a href="https://www.schule-plus.de/">SchulePLUS</a> and 40 excited data scientists to take a stab at real analytical challenges the non-profits are facing. (Find the German article <a href="https://blog.dssg-berlin.org/datenanalyse-f%C3%BCr-berufliche-orientierung-und-krebs-wissensmanagement-96aa7a7ffd3d">here</a>)</p>

<p>SchulePLUS is a social business that aims to help make access to education and early career opportunities equally attainable for every child, and to foster creative and practice-oriented education. For this reason, SchulePLUS has built the platform <a href="https://www.schülerpraktikum.de">https://www.schülerpraktikum.de</a> that helps school kids find internships with local companies and organisations. Thanks to Google Grants, the organisation has been collecting data about Google searches and Adwords for the last 12 months. At the Data Dive, SchulePLUS wanted to learn from this data whether the internships offered on their platform actually match the demand by the pupils. And our data divers did find interesting matches/mismatches, e.g. that there is a lack of internships in public service and science. Even more importantly, data divers taught SchulePLUS staff how to do some of these analysis themselves — helping social orgs help themselves digitally!</p>

<p>The Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft (German Cancer Society) is Germany’s largest oncological society/association. The knowledge and information management team at DKG is currently building a knowledge base covering studies and meta analyses published in the last ten years on the topic of solid cancers like breast, colorectal or prostate cancer. To this end, they scan medical databases, extract publication metadata and pdf, and add fine-grained, multi-level keywords identifying the tumor and focus (e.g. diagnostic, therapy) of the studies. The aim for the Data Dive was to investigate whether at least some of these tasks can be automated using machine learning. Multiple groups of data divers were enthusiastic to work on this project — with some groups concentrating on classification models, others on unsupervised methods like topic modeling and some on the more practical side of finding a software solution that can be easily integrated into the DKG workflow. And the results of all their efforts were very encouraging — it seems like it is indeed possible to build models that can support DKG in their work! DSSG Berlin, the data ambassadors for this project and some of the data divers are now going to work with DKG to see how we can turn these proof-of-concepts into solutions that they can use in their work.</p>

<p>It was an eventful weekend and we are super happy with how everything turned out. We are grateful that so many volunteers showed up and donated their time. In particular, we would not have been able to do it without our volunteer data ambassadors who started collaborating with the non-profits long before the Data Dive, to prepare the data, and who are now helping getting the results into the organisations. Of course, we would like to thank Krebsgesellschaft and SchulePlus for participating with an open mind and filling us with confidence that our work can make an impact.</p>

<p>A big thank you to our sponsors <a href="https://tech.zalando.com/">Zalando</a>, <a href="https://www.getyourguide.de/">GetYourGuide</a>, <a href="https://www.unbelievable-machine.com/">*um</a> und der <a href="https://www.stiftung-nv.de/de">Stiftung Neue Verantwortung</a> for helping us feed our volunteers, as well as <a href="http://www.bmw-stiftung.de/">BMW Foundation</a>, in particular Armin Pialek, who have provided us with the great location. Big thanks also to Claudia Schluckebier (Proboneo) who is always supporting us in the background. Finally, we want to thank DataKind, who have been a long-time inspiration for our work and who allowed us to use the name Data Dive for this event.</p>
